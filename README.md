# Motivation Overview

I set out to learn the fundamentals of the Swift language, SwiftUI, and iOS development.

I created a program that will give motivational quotes based on which area of human weakness the user is struggling with. 

This is a rough idea for an actual application I'm wanting to write that will help inspire the downtrodden student, proffesional, or everyday person.

Written in the Swift Language using SwiftUI. 

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* Resolve the double back button at the top. 
* Expound on the available resources for help (quotes). 
* Create a nice looking user interface.
